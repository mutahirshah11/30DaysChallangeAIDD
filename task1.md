# 30-Day Challenge Task 1 💡

### 1. What does AI-Driven Development mean to me? 🤔

AI-Driven Development means using AI to help build software at every step. Instead of writing every line of code manually, we guide the AI with instructions, and it helps with planning, coding, testing, fixing bugs, and deployment. In this new way of working, we don’t act like traditional programmers , we become the orchestrators, telling the AI what to build and how to refine it, while the AI does most of the repetitive and technical work.

### 2. How do you see the future of Human–AI Collaboration in software development?

In the future, humans and AI will work together like a team in software development. AI will handle most of the coding, testing, and bug fixing, while humans will give instructions, make decisions, and review the results. We won’t need to write every line of code ourselves. Instead, we will tell the AI what we want, and it will build it for us. This means we will become the orchestrators or directors, and the AI will act like a super fast, smart assistant who never gets tired.
